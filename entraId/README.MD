I used chatGPT to generate the following case study that covers the main topics in [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-104#manage-azure-identities-and-governance-2025](Manage azure identities and governance 20-25%).

Hereâ€™s a case study for hands-on implementation:

### Case Study: **AdventureWorks Modernization Project**

AdventureWorks, a fictional retail company, is undergoing a digital transformation to modernize its IT infrastructure and improve operational efficiency. The IT team has been tasked with leveraging Azure services to manage identities, secure access, enforce governance, and optimize costs.

### Objectives

1. **Identity Management**
   - Create user accounts for new employees and guest accounts for external consultants.
   - Organize users into logical groups based on roles (e.g., Sales, IT, HR).
   - Assign Microsoft 365 licenses to appropriate users.
   - Enable and configure Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR).

2. **Access Management**
   - Assign Azure roles to users and groups to provide least privilege access for managing:
     - A web application in a specific resource group.
     - Shared storage across the subscription.
   - Interpret access assignments to verify proper configuration.

3. **Governance and Resource Management**
   - Implement Azure Policy to enforce tagging on all resources.
   - Configure resource locks to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources (e.g., production database).
   - Apply descriptive tags (e.g., Environment, Owner) to all resources for better management.
   - Organize resources into appropriate resource groups.

4. **Subscription and Cost Management**
   - Manage subscriptions under a management group hierarchy (e.g., Production, Development).
   - Set up alerts and budgets for monitoring costs of the subscription.
   - Use Azure Advisor to review recommendations for cost optimization and implement at least one suggestion.

### Tasks to Implement

1. **Identity Management**
   - Use Microsoft Entra ID to:
     - Create user accounts and organize them into groups like *SalesTeam*, *ITAdmin*, and *HRDept*.
     - Assign and revoke licenses.
     - Invite external users (e.g., consultants) and configure their access.
     - Enable SSPR for all users in the directory.

2. **Access Management**
   - Create custom roles if necessary and assign them to:
     - The *SalesTeam* to manage specific applications.
     - The *ITAdmin* group to manage virtual machines in a specific resource group.
   - Use Azure CLI or PowerShell to check and validate access assignments.

3. **Governance**
   - Apply Azure Policies to enforce the "Resource must have a tag" policy.
   - Implement locks on critical resources to avoid accidental deletions.
   - Create and assign resource tags for tracking.

4. **Subscription and Cost Management**
   - Organize your resources into a hierarchy using management groups:
     - Root group: *AdventureWorks*
     - Sub-groups: *Production* and *Development*.
   - Set budgets on the subscription and configure alerts for cost thresholds.
   - Use Azure Advisor to identify a cost-saving opportunity (e.g., resizing or shutting down idle VMs).

### Deliverables
- A detailed report or scripts demonstrating the completion of each task.
- Documentation of the role assignments, policies applied, and resource organization.
- An analysis of cost optimizations implemented.

This case study provides a comprehensive simulation of real-world Azure management aligned with AZ-104 topics. Let me know which specific tools (Azure CLI, PowerShell, Terraform) you want to prioritize, and I can guide you step-by-step for implementation!
